Make test data for the problem.

To set up this script, do the following:
    - Set the seed to be something different, long, and arbitrary.
    - Set up the TestCase class to hold relevant information for your problem.
    - Write sample and secret tests in their respective functions.
    - Write input and output code in their respective functions.
Everything else will be handled by the make_data function in calico_lib.py.

You can also run this file with the -v argument to see debug prints.
